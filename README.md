Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python and the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn  
Data
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It includes various medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating whether or not the individual has diabetes.

Dataset Description
Attributes:
Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
Glucose: Glucose level
BloodPressure: Blood pressure
SkinThickness: Skin thickness
Insulin: Insulin level
BMI: Body mass index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age of the individual
Outcome: Target variable (1 for positive diabetes test, 0 for negative)
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/ronakcoxter/Diabetes-Prediction-ML.git  
cd Diabetes-Prediction-ML  
Open the Jupyter Notebook file:

bash
jupyter notebook Diagnosing the data project.ipynb  
Follow the sections in the notebook to execute the code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

Model Evaluation
After training the model, various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will be computed to assess the modelâ€™s performance.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict diabetes risk, potentially aiding in early diagnosis and intervention. Future work could include refining the model, incorporating additional data sources, or creating a user-friendly interface.
